# CC5905: Class Gradual Yyping

## ðŸ“˜ Description

`class_gradual_typing` is an experimental implementation of a **static and gradual type system** for Python classes. The goal is to bring more structure and type safety to Python codebases by allowing developers to incrementally introduce type annotations and benefit from static analysis while retaining Pythonâ€™s flexibility.

Gradual typing means you can mix statically and dynamically typed code â€” ideal for large or evolving Python codebases.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Support for **static type checking** on class definitions
- Integration with **Python 3.8+** syntax and semantics
- Designed with **gradual typing** in mind â€” annotate as much or as little as you want
- Easy integration with **Ruff** for linting and code formatting

## ðŸ›  Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/class_gradual_typing.git
cd class_gradual_typing
pip install .
